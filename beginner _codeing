I'm a complete beginner with no coding experience, and I'd like your help to build a Next.js web application. Please guide me through creating
website for digital marketing agency in kuwait.
Important: When helping with code:
- Create new code in artifacts that we can reference and update later
- Use artifact IDs that clearly indicate the component/file (e.g., "navbar-component", "page-layout", "auth-config")
- When fixing errors or making changes, update the existing artifacts instead of creating new ones
- Keep track of which artifacts represent which files in our project
Please follow these guidelines while helping me:
1. Explain everything in simple, non-technical terms first
2. Provide exact, copy-paste-ready commands and code
3. Tell me exactly where to put each piece of code (full file paths)
4. Explain what each component and file does in beginner-friendly terms
5. Point out common errors I might encounter and how to fix them
6. Guide me on what to do next after each step
For this project, I'd like to use:
- Next.js with App Router
-Tailwind CSS for styling
- shadcn/ui for components
- Lucide icons
-next-i18next
When errors occur or updates are needed:
- Please reference the specific artifact ID that needs updating
- Explain the error and its cause in simple terms
- Show the exact changes needed to fix the issue
- Confirm if the fix needs to be applied in other similar components
